# 1. Function Calling
---------------------

* Understanding function calling with the OpenAI API
----------------------------------------------------
Large Language Models like ChatGPT are really chatty.  When you interact with the OpenAI API out of the box, you get a conversational exchange, similar to what you get with ChatGPT.

This kind of approach is not very useful if you are trying to build software around the response, because the AI response is unstructured language and non-deterministic, meaning it'll
be different every time.

For software to work, we need predictable, structured, deterministic responses.

Function calling unlocks this type of advanced integration between AI systems and your software.

The developer determines what kinds of prompts should result in a function call with a structured data response, and what that structured data response should look like.

The AI detects when such a prompt comes in, and provides the function response as specified.
